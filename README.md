# Medi-Cali-County-statistics
This project showcases the data collected from CHHS Open Data website. Which gives us information on Medicaid of California enrollment as well as HPSA(Health Professional Shortage Areas) information. Utilizing the two datasets together, we can determine the counties corrolation to the number of individuals enrolled within Medicaid of California and how the counties HPSA score. 
This model uses both data cleaning, data exploration, and data visualization using matplotlib.
